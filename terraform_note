In this tutorial, you will use Terraform to provision a VPC, load balancer, and EC2 instances on AWS. 
Then you will use the count argument to provision multiple 
EC2 instances per private subnet with a single resource block.

The count argument replicates the given resource or module a specific number of times with an incrementing counter.
It works best when resources will be identical, or nearly so.

Once you have created a Terraform Cloud account and created or joined an organization, you can start managing 
infrastructure with Terraform Cloud. In this tutorial, you will create a CLI-driven workspace.

Use the Amazon Web Services (AWS) provider to interact with the many resources supported by AWS. You must configure
the provider with the proper credentials before you can use it.

Terraform Cloud uses Sentinel as part of Teams & Governance to enable granular policy control for your infrastructure.
Sentinel is a language and policy framework, which restricts Terraform actions to defined, allowed behaviors. Policy 
authors manage Sentinel policies in Terraform Cloud with policy sets, which are groups of policies. 
Organization owners control the scope of policy sets by applying certain policy sets to the entire organization or to select workspaces.
